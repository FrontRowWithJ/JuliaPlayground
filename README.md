# JuliaPlayground
Julia Playground is an interactive gui (tkinter) that allows the user to display and interact with the mandelbrot set and corresponding Julia set.

#### Use
```Windows:``` Double-click on JuliaPlayground.py or if you're using cmd, navigate to the file directiory where the script is located and type: ```python JuliaPlayground.py``` _(I recommend the later approach because it will be easier to figure out what dependencies are missing.)_  
```Linux/macOS: ``` Open the cli and type: ```python3 JuliaPlayground.py```
  
#### Dependencies
* ```Python 3 or later```
* ```Tkinter```
* ```Numba```
* ```Numpy```
  
#### Installation  
```Windows``` For installing the libraries, I recommend using pip instead of Anaconda to avoid the potential error of missing DLL files.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anaconda:  ```conda install [library name]``` or ```conda update [library name]```  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pip:  (The command for Windows installation is the same as Linux/macOS)  
```Linux/macOS:``` If you have pip installed, open the cli and type ```pip install [library name]```
